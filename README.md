# HPC Presentation: Linear Systems in C

Solving linear systems in C using various matrix decompositions (QR, LU, Cholesky). 

Very little theory on the actual mathematical rational/proof is presented. Please see Numerical Linear Algebra by Trefethen and Bau for that (especially for differences in Gram-Schmidt, Modified Gram-Schmidt, and Householder Reflection QR algorithms).
